## Summary
>When it comes to the protocol standards that run the Internet, we use the TCP/IP model since this is the widely used and adopted standard due to its simplicity and backwards compatibility with other devices. However, when it comes to explaining things in theory, we use the OSI model due to its hierarchial structure and this is widely taught in networking.


### What have I learned so far?
- The Application Layer of the TCP/IP model has equivalent 3 layers of the OSI model (uses *DATA UNIT*)

	- [[Application (OSI) | Application]]
	- [[Presentation (OSI) | Presentation]]
	- [[Session (OSI) | Session]]

- The Transport Layer of TCP/IP also uses the Transport layer of the OSI model (uses *Segment Header*)

	- [[Transport (OSI) | Transport]]

- The Network Layer of TCP/IP also uses the Network layer of the OSI model (uses *Packet Header*)
	- [[Network Layer (OSI)| Network]]

- TheNetwork Access - Link Layer of the TCP/IP model has equivalent 2 layers of the OSI model (uses *frame header/trailer | bits*)

	- [[Data Link (OSI) | Data Link]]
	- [[Physical (OSI) | Physical]]
