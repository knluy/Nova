## Network Topology

>Network topology is the arrangement of the elements (links, nodes, etc.) of a communication network. Network topology can be used to define or describe the arrangement of various types of telecommunication networks, including command and control radio networks, industrial fieldbusses and computer networks.

### Common Types

- [[Ring Topology]]
- [[Partial Mesh Topology]]
- [[Star Topology]]
- [[Full mesh Topology]]
- [[Bus Topology]]
- [[Tree Topology]]

### Links

The transmission media (often referred to in the literature as the physical media) used to link devices to form a computer network include:
- Electrical cables ([[What is Ethernet | Ethernet]], HomePNA, power line communication, G.hn)
- Optical fiber ([[Network Cabling#Fiber Optic]])
- Radio waves ([[Wireless Networking]])

In the OSI model, these are defined at layers 1 and 2 â€” the physical layer and the data link layer.
