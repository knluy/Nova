## What is Ethernet
**Definition:**
>Ethernet is the traditional technology for connecting devices in a wired local area network (LAN) or wide area network (WAN). It enables devices to communicate with each other via a protocol, which is a set of rules or common network language.

Ethernet describes how network devices format and transmit data so other devices on the same LAN or campus network can recognize, receive and process the information. An Ethernet cable is the physical, encased wiring over which the data travels.

### Advantages and disadvantages of Ethernet

Ethernet has many benefits for users, which is why it grew so popular. However, there are a few disadvantages as well.

#### **Advantages of Ethernet**
-   relatively low cost;
-   backward compatibility;
-   generally resistant to noise;
-   good data transfer quality;
-   speed;
-   reliability; and
-   data security, as common firewalls can be used.


#### **Disadvantages of Ethernet**
-   intended for smaller, shorter distance networks;
-   limited mobility;
-   use of longer cables can create crosstalk;
-   doesn't work well with real-time or interactive applications;
-   speeds decrease with increased traffic;
-   receivers don't acknowledge the reception of data packets; and
-   troubleshooting is hard when trying to trace which specific cable or node is causing the issue.

**Features:**
- [[LAN]]
- IEEE 802.3
- Uses [[CSMA-CD]]
- Operates in [[Data Link (OSI) | Data Link]] and [[Physical (OSI) | Physical Layer (OSI)]]

### Evolution of Ethernet

1. 1970 - Ethernet was created by Xerox PARC
2. 1983 - IEEE 802.3 was standardized (Ethernet)
3. 1985 - Thicknet/ Thinnet (10 Mbps)
4. 1995 - Fast Ethernet (100 Mbps)
5. 1999 - Gigabit Ethernet (1 Gbps)
6. 2006 - 10 Gig (10 Gbps)
7. 2010 - 100 GigE (100 Gbps)
8. 2017 - TerabitE ( 200 Gbps)
