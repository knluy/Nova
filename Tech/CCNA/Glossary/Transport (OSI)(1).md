## Transport Layer (OSI)

Definition:
>The [[Transport Layer]] provides the `functional and procedural` means of transferring variable-length data sequences from a source to a destination host, while maintaining the quality of service functions.

Notes:
- The [[Transport Layer]] may control the reliability of a given link through flow control, [[Segmentation]]/desegmentation, and error control. Some protocols are state- and connection-oriented. 

- The [[Transport Layer]] may also provide the `acknowledgement of the successful data transmission` and sends the next data if no errors occurred. The [[Transport Layer]] creates segments out of the message received from the application layer. 

**Types of Transport Protocols:**
 
 - [[TCP]] - Transmission Control Protocol 
-  [[UDP]] - User Datagram Protocol
