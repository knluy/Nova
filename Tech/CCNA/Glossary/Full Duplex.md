## Full Duplex
**Definition:**
>A full-duplex (FDX) system allows communication in both directions, and, unlike half-duplex, allows this to happen simultaneously.

In **full-duplex mode**, ==both stations can transmit and receive simultaneously.== In full_duplex mode, signals going in one direction share the capacity of the link with signals going in another direction, this sharing can occur in two ways: 

- Either the link must contain two physically separate transmission paths, one for sending and the other for receiving.
- Or the capacity is divided between signals travelling in both directions. 
 
Full-duplex mode is used when communication in both directions is required all the time. The capacity of the channel, however, must be divided between the two directions. 
Example: Telephone Network in which there is communication between two persons by a telephone line, through which both can talk and listen at the same time.
