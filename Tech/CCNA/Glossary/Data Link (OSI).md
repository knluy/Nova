## Data Link Layer (OSI)

**Definition:**
>The data link layer provides node-to-node data transfer —a link between two directly connected nodes. It detects and possibly corrects errors that may occur in the physical layer. It defines the protocol to establish and terminate a connection between two physically connected devices. It also defines the protocol for flow controlbetween them.

IEEE 802 divides the `data link layer` into two sublayers:

- [[Mac Addresses]] Layer – responsible for controlling how devices in a network gain access to a medium and permission to transmit data.
- [[Logical link control ]] (LLC) layer – responsible for identifying and encapsulating network layer protocols, and controls error checking and frame synchronization.
