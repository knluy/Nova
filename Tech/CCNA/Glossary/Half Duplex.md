## Half Duplex
>A half-duplex (HDX) system provides communication in both directions, but only one direction at a time, not simultaneously in both directions. Typically, once a party begins receiving a signal, it must wait for the transmission to complete, before replying.

In half-duplex mode, each station can both transmit and receive, but not at the same time. When one device is sending, the other can only receive, and vice versa. The half-duplex mode is used in cases where there is no need for communication in both directions at the same time. The entire capacity of the channel can be utilized for each direction. 

Example: Walkie-talkie in which message is sent one at a time and messages are sent in both directions.
