### Notes:
- Media Access Control is a 48-bit address that is split across six octets and notated in hexadecimal. 
- The first three octets are assigned to a device manufacturer, known as the organizationally unique identifier ([[OUI]]), and the manufacturer is responsible for ensuring that the last three octets are unique.
