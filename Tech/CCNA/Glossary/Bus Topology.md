## Bus Topology

>Alternatively referred to as line topology, bus topology is a network setup where each computer and network device is connected to a single cable or backbone. Depending on the type of computer network card, a coaxial cable or an RJ-45 network cable is used to connect them together.

### Advantages
- It works well when you have a small network.
- It's the easiest network topology for connecting computers or peripherals in a linear fashion.
- It requires less cable length than a star topology.

### Disadvantages
- It can be difficult to identify the problems if the whole network goes down.
- It can be hard to troubleshoot individual device issues.
- Bus topology is not great for large networks.
- Terminators are required for both ends of the main cable.
- Additional devices slow the network down.
- If a main cable is damaged, the network fails or splits into two.
