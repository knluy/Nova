#### Uses of SSID by devices

Wireless devices like phones, laptops, etc `scan the local area for networks` broadcasting their SSIDs and present a list of names. A user can join a new network connection by picking a name from the list. In addition to obtaining the network’s name, the Wi-Fi scan also determines `whether each network has wireless security options enabled or not`. In most cases, the device identifies a secured network with a lock symbol next to the SSID. 

#### Problem with SSIDs

1.  If there are no wireless security options enabled on a network then anyone can connect to it by knowing only the SSID.   
  
2.  Using a default SSID increases the chances that another nearby network will have the same name which can confuse wireless clients.

3.  The SSID chosen for a home network should contain only generic and sensible information.

4.  An SSID can contain publicly visible or offensive language or coded messages.
