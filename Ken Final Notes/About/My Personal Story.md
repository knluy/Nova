# About Me

This is me (circa 2021)


![[about me.jpg | 300]]


Not much of me is known in public, especially in social media. I have an introverted trait and a personality can almost compare to a nerd/geek, somewhere in between (i guess, 75% geek, 24% nerd, 1% sociable), though i have no glasses to prove this.

I am currently living in Zamboanga City, living with my aunt and grandma, and currently working from home (since pandemic has partially cemented our WFH setup, cause i dont want to go back to manila haha!). I have a pakingkang/ loving girlfriend (more about her on the next section - [[My Girlfiend]]) that always compliments my attitude and always supports and loves me so dearly.

I am a [[Network Engineer]] , taking up with the role of Assosciate NOC Engineer, and a licensed [[Electronics Engineer]] with major focus on Telco and IT Industry, with certifications in CCNA and Silverpeak. More on this to talk in [[Certifications]].

I have an unusual set of hobbies, then can almost feels weird when someone will ask me, especially on interviews and applications, because these sets of hobbies were both from the opposite side of the spectrum:

#### Tech Related:
 - Building/Flying [[Drones]]
 - Playing Online/Offline casual Games
 - Studying for [[Certifications]]
 - Reviewing [[CCNA HOME | CCNA]]
 - Preparing for [[CCNP]] exam, more about it on [[Career Goals]]
 - Fixing Hardware issues on [[Gadgets]]
 - Playing [[Nintendo 3DS]] and [[Nintendo Switch]]
 - Research on anyting Tech related

#### Non-tech related:
- Playing [[Guitar]]
- Playing [[Keyboard Piano]]
- Reading [[Psychology]] Books
- Reading [[Self-Help]] Books
- Reading [[Relationship]] Books and Advices
- Sometimes, me and my girlfriend will setup [[Adventures]] for a change of pace
