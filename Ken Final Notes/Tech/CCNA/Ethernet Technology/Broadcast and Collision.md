## Broadcast and Collision
Listed here are the comparison between broadcast domain and collision domain in Ethernet Technology:

### [[Broadcast Domain]] 
- Under 1 subnet

Sample of Broadcast Domain:

- [[Switch]] - 1 big Broadcast Domain
	- If I have 48 ports, i will have 48 collision domain, but only 1 broadcast domain
	- If I have 48 ports, and 2 [[VLAN]]s, I will have 48 collision domains, but 2 broadcast domains


### [[Collision Domain]] 
- Signals might "collide"

Sample of Collision Domain:
 - [[Hub]] - 1 Hub equals 1 big [[Collision Domain]]


### A Perfect example of a Broadcast and Collision Domain
