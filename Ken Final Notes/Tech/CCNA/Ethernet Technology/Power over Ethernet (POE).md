## Power over Ethernet (POE)

**Definition:**
>Power over Ethernet (PoE) is a ==*technique for delivering DC power to devices over copper Ethernet cabling*==, eliminating the need for separate power supplies and outlets. While PoE doesn't add Ethernet data capabilities, it does offer expanded options for how and where Ethernet end devices can be placed.
