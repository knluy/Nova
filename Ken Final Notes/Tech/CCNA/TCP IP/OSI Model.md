## OSI Model

**Definition:**
>The __Open Systems Interconnection model (OSI model)__ is a `conceptual model` that characterises and standardises the communication functions of a telecommunication or computing system without regard to its underlying internal structure and technology. Its goal is the interoperability of diverse communication systems with standard communication protocols.

### Layer Architecture

- [[Application (OSI)]] - Interface for receiving and sending data
- [[Presentation (OSI)]] - Formatting of data and encryption
- [[Session (OSI)]] - Tracking of packets
- [[Transport (OSI)]] - End-to-end communication between devices
- [[Network Layer (OSI)]] - Logical addressing and routing of packets
- [[Data Link (OSI)]] - Hardware addressing
- [[Physical (OSI)]] - Media type and connector

## Notes:

OSI uses [[Data Encapsulation]] to encapsulate and send the information over the physical medium.
- Although this model is not used anymore, this is still the widely taught model for networking
