## Physical Topology

**Definition:**
>Physical topology refers to the interconnected structure of a local area network (LAN). The method employed to connect the physical devices on the network with the cables, and the type of cabling used, all constitute the physical topology. This contrasts with logical topology, which describes a network's media signal performance and how it exchanges device data.

Logical network topology is not always mapped to a specific physical topology. For example, twisted pair Ethernet is logical bus topology that is mapped to a physical star topology plan, while IBM's token ring is a logical ring topology that is physically implemented as a star topology.
