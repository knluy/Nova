## UDP

**Definition:**

>In computer networking, the **User Datagram Protocol (UDP)** is one of the core members of the Internet protocol suite. With UDP, computer applications can send messages, in this case referred to as `datagrams`, to other hosts on an Internet Protocol (IP) network. Prior communications are not required in order to set up communication channels or data paths.

UDP results in speedier communication because it `does not spend time forming a firm connection with the destination` before transferring the data. Because establishing the connection takes time, eliminating this step results in faster data transfer speeds.
