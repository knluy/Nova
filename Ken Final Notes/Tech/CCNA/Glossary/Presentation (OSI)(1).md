## Presentation Layer (OSI)

**Definition:**
>The presentation layer `establishes context between application-layer entities`, in which the application-layer entities may use different syntax and semantics if the presentation service provides a mapping between them. If a mapping is available, presentation protocol data units are encapsulated into session protocol data units and passed down the protocol stack.
