#### How does segmentation work?

Segmentation works by `controlling how traffic flows among the parts`. You could choose to stop all traffic in one part from reaching another, or you can limit the flow by traffic type, source, destination, and many other options. `How you decide to segment your network` is called a segmentation policy.

#### What is an example of segmentation?

Imagine a large bank with several branch offices. The bank's security policy restricts branch employees from accessing its financial reporting system. Network segmentation can enforce the security policy by `preventing all branch traffic from reaching the financial system`. And by reducing overall network traffic, the financial system will work better for the financial analysts who use it.

#### What enforces segmentation policy?

Some traditional technologies for segmentation included internal firewalls, and Access Control List (ACL) and Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) configurations on networking equipment. However, these approaches are costly and difficult.
