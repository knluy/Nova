>Alternatively referred to as a star network, star topology is one of the most common network setups. In this configuration, every node connects to a central network device, like a hub, switch, or computer. The central network device acts as a server and the peripheral devices act as clients.

In a star topology setup, either a coaxial or RJ-45 network cable is used, depending on the type of network card installed in each computer. The image shows how this network setup gets its name, as it is shaped like a star.
